# Comparing infant HIV screening strategies using RShiny

R Shiny app 1
The cost-effectiveness of Infant HIV Testing Strategies web tool, which is designed to estimate the health benefits and cost-effectiveness of screening mothers at immunization visits (as part of the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI)) to determine infant exposure, followed by diagnostic testing of exposed infants compared to the current WHO-recommended EID strategy (testing only known HIV-exposed infants).

R Shiny app 2
The Clinical and Economic Value of Provider-Initiated HIV Testing and Counseling in Children web tool, which is designed to estimate clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of provider-initiated HIV testing and counseling (PITC) compared to no PITC in a cohort of children composed of HIV-unexposed, HIV-exposed uninfected, and HIV-infected children between 2-10 years old, in a given country, in a given year.
